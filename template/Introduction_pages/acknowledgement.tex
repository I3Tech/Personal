The present document, resulting of six months of research, would not have been possible without the help, encouragements and support of many persons. I thank all of them and I present them all my gratitude.

\medskip

Special thanks are due to my adviser, Professor Alain Holeyman  (Head of Division of Civil Engineering, UCL), who initiated  this research and who trusted me by giving me the opportunity to perform it. His help, insight and encouragements were never  missing. Moreover, he has taught me much more than just the  concepts  of  soil mechanic. He gave me the keys to organise the work in an efficient, accurate, creative
and autonomous way.

\medskip

Profuse  thanks  go  equally  to  Professor  W.  Van  Impe  (Laboratory  of  Soil
Mechanic,   Ghent   University)   and   to   Professor   J-F   Thimus   (Division   of   Civil
Engineering,  UCL)  for  their  participation  to  my  thesis  committee.  I  had  the  privilege
to have a very active committee that met 4 or 5 times per year for long and interesting
discussions. These meetings brought every time a lot of comments and new ideas that
pushed forward the research. I wish all PhD students have such an active committee.

\medskip

I  would  also  like  to  warmly  thank  Rune  Dyvik  (Norwegian  Geotechnical
Institute)  for  the  help,  the  insights  and  the  comments  he  gave  me  without  restraint.  I
am glad he accepted to be a member of the jury of this thesis. I appreciate particularly
the precise and efficient reviewing of the complete thesis he performed for the private
defence.
